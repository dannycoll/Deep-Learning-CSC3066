The method returns $\\Theta(wx+b)$, where $\\Theta$ is the activation function. Note that we multiply `x` and `w` using the `dot` function, rather than using `@` as it was done during lectures. This is because for some of the exercises we will need for `x` and `w` to be scalars, and `@` only works with vectors/matrices.

Note that the main challenge of this task is finding the values of parameters `w` and `b`, which allows the perceptron to implement the NOT logical function.
